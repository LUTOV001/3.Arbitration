**UCB FinTech Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge**
# *Crypto Arbitration Analysis*
## Introduction

    The Bootcamp Module 3 Challenge - Cyrpto Arbitration consists of a quantitative analysis of an arbitration scenario for bitcoin prices occuring in two different exchanges - BitStamp and Coinbase - during the first 3 months of 2018 (e.g. Q1 2018)
---
## Goals and Objectives

    The objective is for the analyst to provide a programatic solution to find, qualify and measure (e.g. calculating profitability) arbitration opportunities for Bitcoin trading in two separate exchanges, BitStamp and Coinbase using pricing data for Q1 2018. The challenge is to be com[leted completing these overall objctives:]

    1. Collect the data from the 2 BitCoin exchanges for the period 
    2. Prepare the data to be able to conduct the analysis
    3. Present the data to identify the specific dates for the arbitration opportunities
    4. Qualify these opportunities based on the profitability margin and calculate the expected profitability for the identified dates
    5. Provide a report on the arbitration trends and opportunities found
